    "\n",
    "### Explanation of `bitlogic.main(new String[0]);`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`bitlogic`**: \n",
    "   - Refers to the class name `bitlogic` that you defined.\n",
    "   - This tells Java to look for the `main` method inside this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`.main`**: \n",
    "   - Accesses the `main` method of the `bitlogic` class.\n",
    "   - In Java, the `main` method serves as the **entry point** of any program that can be run.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`new String[0]`**:\n",
    "   - This creates an **empty array of Strings** (`String[]`) as the parameter.\n",
    "   - The `main` method in Java expects an array of strings (`String[] args`), even if it’s not used. This array can hold command-line arguments.\n",
    "   - `new String[0]` essentially means \"I’m not passing any command-line arguments.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why It’s Needed in This Case:\n",
    "- **In Jupyter Notebooks**:\n",
    "  - The class `bitlogic` is defined but doesn’t automatically invoke its `main` method like it would in a typical standalone Java program.\n",
    "  - You must explicitly **call the `main` method** to run your program logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **In Regular Java Environments**:\n",
    "  - When you run a program, the JVM automatically calls the `main` method. In a notebook, this doesn’t happen, so you manually call `main` with `bitlogic.main(new String[0]);`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-Life Equivalent:\n",
    "Think of `main` as the start button of your program. Normally, running a `.java` file presses this button automatically. But here, in Jupyter, you need to **press it manually** by calling `main`.\n",

    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "condition ? expression1 : expression2;\n",

    "- **expression1**: This value is returned if the condition is `true`.\n",
    "- **expression2**: This value is returned if the condition is `false`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How It Works**\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the **condition** evaluates to `true`, the operator returns **expression1**.\n",
    "- If the **condition** evaluates to `false`, it returns **expression2**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "int a = 10, b = 20;\n",
    "int result = (a > b) ? a : b;\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- The condition `(a > b)` is checked. Since `a` is not greater than `b`, the condition is `false`, so the value of `b` (`20`) is assigned to `result`.\n",

    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "int number = 5;\n",

    "In this example:\n",
    "- The condition `(number % 2 == 0)` checks if the number is even. Since `5` is odd, it returns `\"Odd\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Advantages of the Ternary Operator:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Conciseness**: It reduces the need for multi-line `if-else` statements, making the code more compact and easier to read.\n",
    "2. **Conditional Expressions**: Useful when you need to assign a value based on a condition in a single line.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Nested Ternary Operator**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also nest ternary operators, though this can make the code harder to read if overused:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "int a = 5, b = 10, c = 15;\n",

    "In Java, **parentheses** are used to explicitly control the **order of operations** in an expression, overriding the default operator precedence. By enclosing part of an expression in parentheses, you can dictate the order in which the operations are performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Use Parentheses?**\n",
    "Parentheses are used to group expressions or parts of expressions to ensure that certain operations are performed first, regardless of operator precedence. This can make your code more readable and predictable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **General Rule:**\n",
    "- **Parentheses** have the **highest precedence**, meaning that anything inside parentheses is evaluated first.\n",
    "- **Operator precedence** still applies within the parentheses, but parentheses force operations inside them to be evaluated before anything outside them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Basic Example of Parentheses:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "int result = (2 + 3) * 4;  // Parentheses force addition to happen first\n",
    "System.out.println(result);  // Output: 20\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Without parentheses, the multiplication (`*`) would happen first due to its higher precedence over addition (`+`), and the result would be `14`. But with parentheses, `2 + 3 = 5` is evaluated first, then multiplied by `4`, giving `20`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example with Multiple Operators:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "int result = 2 + 3 * 4 / 2;  // Multiplication and division are evaluated first\n",
    "System.out.println(result);  // Output: 8\n",
    "```\n",
    "- In this case, `3 * 4 = 12`, then `12 / 2 = 6`, and finally, `2 + 6 = 8`. However, if you want to change the order:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "int result = (2 + 3) * (4 / 2);  // Addition and division happen first due to parentheses\n",
    "System.out.println(result);  // Output: 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Here, `2 + 3 = 5` and `4 / 2 = 2` are computed first, then `5 * 2 = 10`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **More Complex Example:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "int result = (3 + 5) * 2 - 4 / (2 + 2);  \n",
    "System.out.println(result);  // Output: 12\n",
    "```\n",
    "- The first parentheses `(3 + 5)` is calculated first, then `2 + 2` inside the second parentheses, then division and multiplication are carried out before subtraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Parentheses with Logical Operators:**\n",
    "Using parentheses in logical expressions helps clarify the intended logic:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "boolean result = (5 > 3 && 2 < 4) || (7 == 7);  \n",
    "System.out.println(result);  // Output: true\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Here, `(5 > 3 && 2 < 4)` is evaluated first, followed by `(7 == 7)`, and then the OR (`||`) operation is applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Precedence vs. Parentheses:**\n",
    "Although operator precedence dictates the order of operations, parentheses can change this order. This is useful for improving readability and making code behavior more predictable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Summary:**\n",
    "- **Parentheses** override operator precedence.\n",
    "- **Use parentheses** to clarify the order of operations in complex expressions.\n",
    "- **Parentheses improve readability** and prevent errors in the logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Good Practice:**\n",
    "Even if the operator precedence would naturally evaluate the expression correctly, using parentheses helps clarify the code's intent. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "int result = (a + b) * c;  // Even if not necessary, it's clearer\n",
    "```\n",
